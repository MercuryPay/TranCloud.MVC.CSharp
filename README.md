# Overview

This repository demonstrates how a cloud based Software as a Service (SaaS) POS application can be designed to interact with locally installed peripherals using components supplied by Datacap System, Inc.

The key driver that facilitates this architecture is Datacap Systems' IPTran LT&trade; Mobile which interacts with Datacap's TranCloud server allowing a Point of Sale to interact with TranCloud via http commands and then the TranCloud server interacts with the IPTran LT&trade; Mobile on the POS' behalf.

# Payment Processing

##Step 1: Collect and Format Transaction Information

Utilizing an object model set parameters needed to process a transaction.  The example below shows a credit sale transaction.  The class object is then serialized to JSON represented as a string and then passed to the TranCloud server.


```
var tranCloudTransaction = new TranCloudTransaction();
tranCloudTransaction.TStream = new TStream();
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction = new Transaction();
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.Account = new Account();
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.Account.AcctNo = "SecureDevice";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.Amount = new Amount();
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.Amount.Purchase = "1.11";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.InvoiceNo = "1234";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.MerchantID = "1234";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.OperatorID = "test";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.PartialAuth = "Allow";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.RefNo = "1234";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.SecureDevice = "ONTRAN";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.TranCode = "Sale";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.TranDeviceID = "XYZ";
tranCloudTransaction.TStream.Transaction.TranType = "Credit";

var json = new JavaScriptSerializer().Serialize(tranCloudTransaction);

```


##Step 2: POST Request to TranCloud

Using the .net libraries a web request is made to the TranCloud server POSTing the JSON above.  Note that you need an API username and password from Datacap prior to executing this sample code.


```
var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create("https://trancloud.dsipscs.com");
request.Method = "POST";
request.ContentType = "application/json";

var username = "username";
var password = "password";
var encoded = System.Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(username + ":" + password));
request.Headers.Add("Authorization", "Basic " + encoded);
request.Headers.Add("User-Trace", "testing TranCloud.MVC.CSharp");
request.ContentLength = json.Length;
using (var webStream = request.GetRequestStream())
using (var requestWriter = new StreamWriter(webStream, System.Text.Encoding.ASCII))
{
    requestWriter.Write(json);
}
```


##Step 3: Process and Display Response

TranCloud communicated with the local IPTran LT&trade; Mobile, the IPTran LT&trade; Mobile drives the pinpad device which prompts for customer interaction, the IPTran LT&trade; Mobile forwards the transaction package to Mercury for authorization, and then the response bubbles back to TranCloud and the POS.


```
var tranCloudResponse = new JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize<dynamic>(response);
var rstream = tranCloudResponse["RStream"];
var cmdResponse = rstream["CmdResponse"];
var tranResponse = rstream["TranResponse"];

var paymentResponse = new PaymentInfoResponse();
paymentResponse.AcqRefData = "";
paymentResponse.Amount = "1.11";
paymentResponse.CardholderName = "test test";
paymentResponse.CardType = tranResponse["CardType"];
paymentResponse.DisplayMessage = cmdResponse["TextResponse"];
paymentResponse.ExpDate = tranResponse["ExpDate"];
paymentResponse.MaskedAccount = tranResponse["AcctNo"];
paymentResponse.Token = tranResponse["RecordNo"];
```
